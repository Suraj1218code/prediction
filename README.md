# Dynamic NFT Smart Contract

This repository contains a basic Solidity smart contract for minting dynamic NFTs. It allows users to mint tokens and track ownership.

## Features
- Simple NFT minting functionality
- Ownership tracking
- No external dependencies

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Solidity compiler (`solc`)
- Ethereum development environment (e.g., Hardhat, Remix, or Truffle)

### Deployment Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamic-nft.git
   cd dynamic-nft
   ```
2. Compile the contract using Solidity compiler.
3. Deploy the contract to the desired Ethereum network.
4. Copy and paste the deployed contract address below.

## Contract Address

```

## Usage
- Call the `mint` function to create a new NFT.
- Use `ownerOf(tokenId)` to check the owner of a specific token.
